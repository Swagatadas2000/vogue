            With form-flattering silhouettes and custom creations by big ticket designers, the red carpet has always been a place where celebrities make statements with their sartorial choices. While thigh-high slits and floor-sweeping trains have long ruled awards season, plunging necklines have their own special category amongst note-worthy wardrobe picks by celebrities, Bollywood and Hollywood alike.
            Deepika Padukone’s penchant for ruling the red carpet is well known, and so it comes as no wonder that fans have seen her embrace the deep neckline time and again too. For the premiere of xXx: Return of Xander Cage in 2018, Padukone picked a gold sequinned navel-grazing Naeem Khan gown and last year, the star also stepped out in a couture Amit Aggarwal black gown with a risqué neckline, putting her stamp of approval on the trend.

Along with them, other stars who have given deep necklines their vote of approval also include Kareena Kapoor Khan and Katrina Kaif. Kapoor Khan opted for a heavily embellished number at the Vogue Women of the Year Awards in 2018, while Kaif picked a red Julien Macdonald number for the IIFA Rocks party in 2019.
